##DarkRP Support##
DarkRP 2.7+ ✔️  

DarkRP versions from 2.6 and forward should also work with the script, nothing promised. Always update your DarkRP and don't modify the core functions.

##Description##
This script adds custom keys for DarkRP, which is fully animated (lock, unlock, beep for cars, etc).  
You can unlock/lock instantly, but also have it more realistic and make it follow the keys (this is configurable).  
Other than that it has cool features and supports VCMod with lights flashing when locking and unlocking.  

##Features##
- Lock/Unlock cars on a distance.  
- Realistic lock & unlock animations for both doors and cars.  
- Custom display for lock state on doors that you have permission to lock/unlock.  
- VCMod support (flashes lights when using keys on cars).  
- Realistic equip animation & sounds.  
- Vehicle alarm custom model, sounds and support for VCMod where it flashes lights.  
- Two sets of door locking and unlocking animations.  
- Overwrites default keys on spawn and when changing job.  

##Installation##
This addon supports DarkRP 2.6.+  
Other newer versions should also work. If they do not, please create a ticket so this can be sorted.  

Extract "darkrpadvancedkeys" to your addons!   

The default key weapon will now be replaced with the "Advanced Keys". Position is the same in the weapon scroll.

##Content##
All content needed for this script (models, materials, sounds) are uploaded to the workshop.  

**[Workshop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1443497352)**   

All content is set to download automatically. You can also add the workshop to your servers collection (if you use one).  

##Customizing##
To customize the general addon settings go to darkrpadvancedkeys/lua/autorun/advkeys\_config.lua  

There are about 10 options to configure, mainly focusing on sounds, delays and more!  
This is also where you can choose the secondary sets of door lock/unlock animations. Change ADVKEYS_UsePrimaryAnims to false.  

##Errors & Support##  
If you find any problems with the script, please create a support ticket with details of the situation and a copypaste of the error in console. I am also not interested in modifying you a custom version of the addon. Also not upon payment. Sorry!

Conflicting addons is not to be said if I will support that or not. This is something I will decide upon confrontation about a conflicting addon. If you have some sort of proof that an addon is conflicting with my addon, please send me a PM with the details you might have.

Thank you!
